        Large was created as a mean for discourse, conversation and debate
        between Josephians. Your contribution would mean a lot to this platform.
        Your contribution can come in the form as a snippet or regular article.
        A snippet would fall in the "Snippet" category, while a regular
        article's category can be chosen by you.

      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Write for us</h2>
      <p>
        Writing to us(above), would mean you are a guest contributor. Should you
        choose to write <em>for</em> us, you are a regular. Meaning, you would
        contribute every week with at least one article. Writing for us is not
        an option yet(opening soon perhaps :)), so for now all contributions
        would be as guests.
